      <h1>California Resident Notice at Collection</h1>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act,
        as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“<strong
          >CCPA</strong
        >”), requires us to provide some additional information to California
        residents. This Section only applies to you if you are a California
        resident, although please note that this information and the rights
        afforded herein are the same as offered to our other users in our
        section Privacy Policy. This Section does not apply to personal
        information we collect from our employees and job applicants in their
        capacity as employees and job applicants, as such information practices
        are described in separate policies.

        have the right to opt out of our sale/sharing of your personal

        The CCPA also allows you to limit the use or disclosure of your
        “sensitive personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) if your
        sensitive personal information is used for certain purposes. Please note
